sentence=A fork of Nick O'Leary's PubSubClient to enable protobuf will payloads.
paragraph=This is a fork of Nick O'Leary's PubSubClient, with 1 additional function added for setting the will payload via a buffer and buffer instead of a char. This was the only addition needed to make this library usable with protocols other than plain text in the will (eg. google protocol buffers).
